@page dev-maintain Updating and Maintaining DKAN
@tableofcontents

There are several strategies for maintaining your DKAN site. Maintaining
a DKAN site does not differ substantially from [maintaining other Drupal
sites](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/configuration-management).

@note
  <i class="fas fa-toolbox" style="color: #42b983"></i>
  [DKAN Tools](https://github.com/GetDKAN/dkan-tools) is a project
  containing commands and tools that [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/dkan/)
  uses for our own implementations and deployments.


## Filesystem Conventions

With Drupal's inheritance model, it should not be
necessary to place custom code or modules in the ``modules/contrib/dkan``
directory. Additional modules, themes, or libraries, or newer versions
of ones already present in ``modules/contrib/dkan``, can be placed in
``modules/custom``, ``themes/custom``, or ``libraries/custom``. This will make maintaining your
DKAN site much easier.

If it is necessary or expedient to overwrite files in the
``modules/contrib/dkan`` directory, it is recommended to keep a
[patch](https://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/)
of the changes. A patch will make it possible to re-apply changes once a
newer version of DKAN is added to the ``modules/contrib/dkan`` directory.


## Primary Maintenance Tasks

By "maintenance" we mean three specific tasks

-  **Upgrading** DKAN to receive new features and bug-fixes
-  **Adding** additional modules or features
-  **Overriding** current modules or functionally

## Getting DKAN Updates

DKAN uses a slightly modified [semantic](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/understanding-drupal-version-numbers) versioning system.

**Major.Minor.Patch**

- *Major* indicates compatibility
- *Minor* indicates backwards incompatilble new features or upgrades
- *Patch* indicates a release for security updates, bug fixes, and backwards compatible improvements

Please note *you can not use* ``drush up`` *with DKAN*. This is because
DKAN is not packaged on Drupal.org.

### Basic Upgrades

If you are maintaining your site with [DKAN Tools](https://github.com/getdkan/dkan-tools), upgrading is as simple as running

`dktl make --tag=<tag version>`

Or update the version number in your compser.json file and run `composer update`:

```
"require": {
    "getdkan/dkan": "2.0.0"
}
```

### Overriding current DKAN modules or functionality

Drupal has an inheritance model that makes it easy to override modules.
Ideally you should keep all of your customizations outside of your docroot and symlink
the overrides to the appropriate directory inside docroot.

```
src/modules/ -> docroot/modules/custom
src/themes/  -> docroot/themes/custom
```
