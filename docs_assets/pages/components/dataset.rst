Dataset
=======

A dataset contains a distribution list of individual resources (files, APIs or links that are being shared) as well as metadata. 

Metadata is the “Who, What, When, Where, Why” of each dataset. There are a number of specifications for dataset metadata and DKAN currently complies with the DCAT and `Project Open Data <https://project-open-data.cio.gov/>`_ schemas.

It is possible to add new fields to DKAN to conform to additional specifications or custom requirements.
