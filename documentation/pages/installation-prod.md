@page prod Deploying to other environments
@tableofcontents

We will, of course, want to deploy our application to a production environment (or perhaps a multi-environment host like [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/)) at some point. Or you may wish to use a completely different local development environment from @ref local-dev the one in these docs.

DKAN is based on Drupal software and -- generally -- runs anywhere Drupal is supported. For the most common setup, we reccomend:

-  MySQL: minimum version 5.5.3+ with PDO
-  PHP: minimum version 7.1.x
-  Apache: minimum version 2.x
-  Drush: minimum version 9.x.

More documentation coming soon...
