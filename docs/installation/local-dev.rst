Local Development Environment
=============================

For testing out DKAN locally and doing feature work directly on the software (as opposed to working on a particular, customized website), using a standardized, `docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_-based local environment is recommended. This will ensure you have the same setup as DKAN's core developers, and that your environment is very close to that of our continuous integration tools.

These instructions are geared toward people who want to contribute improvements or fixes to DKAN core. Once you have a working local copy, please make contributions using the `standard fork and pull-request workflow in Gitihub <https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/>`_.

Requirements
------------

To get started working on DKAN core with our toolset you will need the following:

* A Linux or Mac computer (Windows support coming soon)
* `Git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_
* `Docker CE <https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download>`_ (reccomended version: 17.12.1-ce)
* `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_ (reccomended version: 1.19.0)
* `DKAN Tools <https://github/GetDKAN/dkan-tools>`_
